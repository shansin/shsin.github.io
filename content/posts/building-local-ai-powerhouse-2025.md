It has been roughly 20 years since I last cracked open a PC case to build a machine from scratch. Back then, we were worried about IDE cables and jumper pins; today, the stakes are a bit different. My goal this time wasn't just to browse the web—I wanted to run Large Language Models (LLMs) locally.

I was looking for a sandbox for toy projects and experimentation without the leash of a monthly subscription to OpenAI or Anthropic. More importantly, I wanted to "get into the weeds"—fine-tuning models and understanding the hardware bottlenecks firsthand.

### The "Sensible" Alternative

When building for AI, the primary gating factor is **VRAM** (GPU memory). To do anything meaningful, 16GB is the floor, not the ceiling. 

Now, a rational person would have bought a Mac Mini with 24GB+ of unified memory and called it a day. It’s efficient, quiet, and fits in a desk drawer. But where’s the fun in being sensible? I wanted a machine that looked the part and gave me the flexibility to swap components when the next breakthrough hits.

### The Build Specs

To support heavy local inference and future fine-tuning, I landed on a dual-GPU setup that prioritizes memory overhead and core count.

* **GPU 1:** NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti (16GB)
* **GPU 2:** NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti (16GB)
* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D
* **Motherboard:** X870E (Crucial for supporting dual GPUs at PCIe x8/x8)
* **RAM:** 64GB DDR5

| Component        | Role                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total VRAM**   | 32GB (Sufficient for medium-sized 70B parameter models)                         |
| **Logic**        | The Ryzen 9 9950X3D provides the multi-threading needed to keep the GPUs fed.   |
| **Connectivity** | The X870E chipset ensures the second GPU isn't throttled by a narrow data pipe. |

### Why this "Frankenstein" Rig?

By pairing two 16GB cards, I’ve managed to bypass the massive "VRAM tax" associated with the ultra-high-end 5090s while still hitting a respectable **32GB of total VRAM**. 

The choice of the **X870E motherboard** was a specific technical requirement. Most consumer boards choke the second PCIe slot down to x4 speeds; this setup ensures the data pipeline stays wide enough for serious workloads.

It feels good to be back in the BIOS. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some local weights to download and some fans to tune. Let the experimentation begin!
